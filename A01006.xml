            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

 Church; I beganne then to peruſe his Sermon, and note ſome manifeſt ſlaunders, and places of our Authors corrupted by him: yet to confeſſe the truth, I did ſo loath this warre againſt wordes, and againſt Babels, ſeeming moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes and monſters to the eye, but wynd and vanity in very truth, that I was glad of any colourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to fly from the combat. Wherefore a rumour being ſpread, that by publiſhing his <hi>Ieſuits Ghoſpell</hi> the folly and intemperancy therof had offended all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Iudgment, and temperate Diſpoſition, that the Gentlemen of the <hi>Temple</hi> for this reſpect, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in regard of his marriage which many iudged no conuenient quality for their Preacher, did reſolue to diſcharge him of his office forthwith: I began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſoone after quite gaue ouer the intended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to his Sermon, hoping that without my help togeather with the body, the ſhaddowes would vaniſh, the beames of cleare truth entring in their place. But it ſeemeth, men ſpake of <hi>Maiſter Craſhaw,</hi> rather what themſelues thought he deſerued, then what others intended, ſince neither any publick diſlike was ſhewed againſt his intemperate writing, nor the ſweetnes of his marriage did any way mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the bitternes of his tongue; but ſtill both in print, and pulpit, according to the vttermoſt of his skill and power, he imployeth his forces, to darken and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2519:4"/>obſcure with a miſt of ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders the light of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wherefore hauing notice therof, and vrged againe by the renewed requeſt of ſome friends, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to make no further delay to finiſh and publiſh my formerly intended diſcouery of this Miniſter, ſpecially out of griefe, that ſo many of my deare Countreymen ſhould be kept from the cleare water of Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and deluded with empty bug-beares, which ſlaunderers ſet vpon the banks therof, &amp; that the ſmoke of falſhood ſhould (in the inueighled eye of the ſimple) transforme the very pillars of Chriſtianity into ſnakes &amp; adders of blaſphemy, cauſing ſeely ſoules that looke not into things, to abhorre the faire, and goodly cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt his Spouſe, as a den of Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe being finiſhed, I did leſſe repent my labour, hoping the ſame might ſerue not only as a priuate diſcouery of this Preacher, abuſing his credit and ſmall learning, to the perdition of many by faire ſhewes of ſanctity, and greateſt promiſes of exact truth, when he meaneth moſt deceipt; but alſo for three other more generall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which I intend briefly in this Preface to declare, by which you will eaſily perceaue the reaſon of the title therof, and togeather lay open vnto you the motiues vrging me to offer the ſame vnto you.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2519:7"/>to ſuch iniurious dealing. But the caſe now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth otherwiſe about this Sermon, and in ſuch termes that the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot ſeuer her publick diſgrace from his priuate ſhame. For whereas Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks haue often complayned of Miniſters iniurious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them in pulpit, to make them odious vnto the people, by declayming ſlaunders againſt them, but ſpecially of <hi>M. Craſhaw</hi> in this his Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the Croſſe, which they thought ſo exorbitant, as they gaue out (as he himſelf<note n="(a)" place="margin">In his Epiſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory to the Princes Highnes.</note>
 ſaith) that he was called before au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for his immodeſt exceſſe in this kind, which you ſhall ſee by the examination thereof, they had great cauſe to thinke: Whereas I ſay theſe complaynts were made, and this expectation had, that ſome ſigne of publick diſlike would be giuen againſt ſuch intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate preaching, <hi>M. Craſhaw</hi> to ſhew that Authority did not miſlike, but allow his dealing, did not condemne, but patronize it, after ſome moneths taken to thinke of the matter, to view ouer his Sermon, and perchance to leaue out ſome more notorious and ſhamefull vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes which he durſt vtter in pulpit though not in print, at laſt makes the ſame publick, bringing his owne ſhame to light. But to what end? Heare it in his owne words in the Epiſtle dedicatory to the Princes High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: <hi>Not ſo much to cleare my ſelf</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>as to honour the truth, and to ſhew, that it is no trick, nor policy of our State (as it is in Popery) to ſet vp men with authority to rayle, and licence to lye, therby to make our enemyes odious.</hi> Thus he. And in his<note n="(b)" place="margin">This dedication was the firſt, but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sermon.</note>
 Epiſtle to the Lord Treaſurer, he addeth, that he did publiſh his Sermon to honour truth, but much more to iuſtify the State: ſuch deſire doth this Miniſter ſhew to be rather a Stateſman then a true man. But if by the State he vnderſtand thoſe of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2519:8"/>his Maieſties moſt honorable Counſell, he needeth not to iuſtify whom none accuſe, whom their owne Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour doth ſufficiently cleere from any ſuſpition of allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing ſuch diſhonourable dealing, who cannot be ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with theſe Miniſteriall crymes, ſeeing they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the charge, to ſee they bring not ſuch foule thinges into pulpit, vnto their Biſhops, and Prelates, on whom this diſgrace muſt lye, and from them redound vnto their Church. For this their publiſhing of the Sermon to be a patterne of their truth, and modeſty, &amp; to ſhew that our complaints againſt them are vniuſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, was as much as to ſay vnto the Church of <hi>Rome, ab vno diſce omnes,</hi> by this one Miniſter learne all the reſt; ſee how ſincere in accuſing, modeſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, ſolide in reprouing your errours, iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in producing, diligent in peruſing, faithfull in quoting your Authors we are: finally how far from any lying, and rayling, which you falſely lay to our charge. By which alſo you may ſee, that the credit of the Church of <hi>England</hi> lyeth vpon <hi>M. Craſhawes</hi> head, which muſt needs be crackt in peeces, if in this very Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they made publike to iuſtify themſelues, we find rayling and lying, in very exorbitant, or rather impudent manner.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As for his recrimination, that it is a trick in Popery to ſet vp men with authority to rayle and lye, the proofes he bringeth are ſo poore, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerue to diſcouer his fraud and falſhood, and make his impudency more apparent, compared with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our proceeding.<note place="margin">See his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Earle of Saliſbury.</note>

Nay the <hi>Virginian</hi> Church ſhalbe honoured by hauing their names in her firſt Law. And good reaſon, ſeeing the firſt men ſent, and intended as her Apoſtles, were for the moſt part Atheiſts, and prophane fellowes, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth partly confeſſe. But you ſee this wiſe Law-maker out of his hatred vnto Papiſts, will haue them firſt excluded from the Common-Wealth of his owne head and hart before Atheiſts, though he will not vouchſafe to name them, as <hi>Solon</hi> out of extreme ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Parricides left them out in his <hi>Athenian</hi> lawes.

For how can any well in his wits belieue ſuch bookes whoſe authours euen by their beſt friendes are confeſſed to haue written, forgetting themſelues, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paſſage to their paſſions without exact care of truth?

 and poeticall fancyes. And the ſecond is no leſſe notorious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, to wit, to put no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt contemplation, and the obiect therof, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and the matter, the thought and the thing we thinke of, betwixt the breaſts and milke of the Virgin, and deuout conſiderations vpon them. Becauſe <hi>Scriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> compareth his meditations vpon the breaſts of the Virgin, with his meditations vpon the woundes of Chriſt; the Miniſter doth inferre, that he doth equall her breaſts to his woundes, the milke of the Mother with the bloud of the Sonne, which is groſſe miſtaking, and miſconſtruing of things. Often may contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be equally full of comfort or profit, though there be great difference in their obiects. What greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then betwixt heauen and hell, the ioyes of the one, and the paynes of the other? yet many tymes may one, through Gods ſpeciall grace, find as profitable, yea ſometymes as comfortable meditations vpon hell,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2519:21"/>as vpon heauen. When we ſay that hell maketh men auoid ſinne, we doe not vnderſtand that hell hath a certayne power to infuſe grace into a mans ſoule, by which he may auoid ſinne, but only that it is an obiect which may (Gods grace concurring) awake ſuch a good purpoſe in a man. The like is when we ſay, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth make men ſerue God with great comfort, we doe not vnderſtand, that heauen hath any vertue or quality to infuſe grace, but only to be an obiect or motiue of ioyfull going on in Gods ſeruice. So when it is ſayd, that the breaſts or milke of the Virgin do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſoule, heale the diſeaſes thereof, appeaſe anger, enuy, pride, and other raging ſinnes, the ſenſe is, that her breaſts, and the myſtery of her bleſſed milke is an obiect of ſuch deuotion and piety, as deuout contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation on them may bring forth in a ſoule theſe and many other more admirable effects. Moreouer, when one doth meditate on the Virgins breaſts, as ſhe is Gods Mother, the obiect is equall to the obiect we thinke of in the wounds and bloud of Chriſt; becauſe in the breaſts of the Virgin as ſhe is Gods Mother, we muſt needes behould, and contemplate Chriſt in her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall armes, &amp; ſucking her bleſſed breaſts, who though not in bignes of body, yet in Maieſty, power, wiſdome, ſanctity, both as God and man, is equall to himſelf blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Croſſe. Now which obiect is more ſweet, tender, and able to ſtyr vp deuotion in a ſoule, Chriſt ſucking in the armes of his mother, or bleeding on the armes of the Croſſe is a doubt, which did perplexe <hi>S.

               </note>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did) God as an infinit light, or ſea of glory, without bound, in which the world like a ſponge floateth, though God be not indeed as we apprehend; yet are not ſuch apprehenſions erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous or falſe, becauſe we only apprehend him, as ſuch an infinite materiall light, not iudging him to be ſo: nay, we iudge the contrary, yet we muſt ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, becauſe our thoughts can reach no other higher conceipt of him. When we apprehend, and imagine our ſelues in prayer to be before the throne of God, to be kneeling in heauen among the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, as<note n="(k)" place="margin">lib. <hi>2.</hi> de oratione.</note>
               <hi>S. Chryſoſtome,</hi> and other Fathers exhort, this apprehenſion is not falſe, becauſe we do not iudg, and thinke that indeed we are in heauen, but ſo frame our imaginations, thoughts, affections, prayers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpeachs vnto God, as if we were in heauen. And thus may wee make our ſelues preſent in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> or <hi>Nazareth,</hi> vnto the miſtery of Chriſts ſacred Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2519:23"/>or in Mount-Caluary vnto the myſtery of his Croſſe, behoulding him with the eyes of our mynd, as bleeding and dying for vs, which thoughts are not vayne, but cauſes of piety, deuotion, and tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto Chriſt, and his holy life, and therefore of ſingular profit, which any that will make triall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhall vndoubtedly feele.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Hence doth appeare the falſehood, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the Bachelours new doctrine, not taught by any Chriſtian (that I know of) before, to wit, that we muſt not now imagine Chriſt as ſucking his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſts, nor ſpeake vnto him, as to a child, nor as dying vpon the Croſſe, nor conceyue him as a mortall man; to which purpoſe he citeth <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſaying: <hi>We know not Chriſt now according to the fleſh,</hi> that is, ſaith he, not as a meere, and mortall, but as glorifyed man: this doctrine I ſay is the bane of piety and deuotion, and a perpetuall baniſhment of contemplation of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of Chriſts life out of mens harts. For how can they liuely apprehend loue, and imbrace Chriſt as dying vpon the Croſſe for their cauſe, if they may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, or apprehend him as a mortall man. How can they in contemplation waſh his woundes with their teares, or bath themſelues in his bleeding wounds? How can they enter as doues into the holes of that Rock, if they may not ſo much as apprehend death or mortality in him? <hi>S. Pauls</hi> meaning is, that we muſt not belieue nor iudge, nor thinke that Chriſt is now mortall in very truth, and ſubiect to miſery as once he was, as <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> expoundeth; but he doth not deny but we may conceaue Chriſt and ſpeake, and pray vnto him, as to a child, or as crucified, or as repreſented in any other myſtery of his life, imagining thinges paſt ſo liuely, as if
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2519:24"/>we ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſent with the eyes of our mind; though the more litterall ſenſe of the Apoſtles words, <hi>Now we know not Chriſt according to the fleſh,</hi> be, that he had not now a carnall, and fleſhly conceipt of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> &amp; his Kingdome, as he had once with other Iewes before he was conuerted; ſo he ſaith, <hi>that now we know none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh,</hi> that is, we beare not carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto any, wiſhing them carnall and temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. For though we once (ſaith he) <hi>knew Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh,</hi> that is, expected his carnall, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome; now we know him not in that manner, nor conſequently doe we loue carnally any, whom we loue in him, and for him. This now is the third folly of this Bachelour, wherin he ſpendeth the reſt of his Ghoſpell, making no diſtinction betwixt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and iudging of a thing, betwixt imagining &amp; belieuing. We do apprehend Chriſt in our thoughts, as a child, we mentally ſee him, kiſſe, imbrace him, ſpeake vnto him: yet do we not iudge, that he is a child, or a ſucking babe this preſent yeare at <hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> as this Wiſe Man obiecteth, but that he was once a child. Which myſtery that we may know, loue, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the better, we ſet it before the eyes of our mind, not as a thing paſt, but preſent, and behaue our ſelues in our imaginations, thoughts, and affections, as we would doe indeed, were he truly, and really preſent before vs. This is the manner of meditation, moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, deuout, and profitable, which to Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſeemeth (I dare ſay) a new Ghoſpell, though it hath euer bene practiſed by all ſpirituall men: but no wonder at their ignorance heerin, ſeeing the ſenſuall or carnall man conceaueth not the things of the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p n="35">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:2519:24"/>35. A fourth example of folly, is his fury againſt Ieſuits, becauſe this Poet, in his imaginary contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application of the internal ſenſes vnto the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſts childhood, doth feare to approach vnto the ſacred, and venerable breaſts of the Virgin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing himſelf vnworthy of ſuch an honour &amp; fauour, in regard of his grieuous ſinnes: wherfore he doth in his contemplation &amp; thoughts, rather run to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſtes bloud, begging one precious drop for that end, which he doth expreſſe in a moſt diuine ſweet and admirable verſe. Heere the Bachelour keepeth a great ſtyr, &amp; rageth for many leaues<note n="(l)" place="margin">From the pag. <hi>66.</hi> of his Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, to the <hi>77.</hi>
               </note>
 togeather, that the Ieſuits thinke the Virgins milke to be more pure, &amp; precious then Chriſts bloud, to which they dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, though not to her breaſts. Where he is ſo void of iudgment, as he would haue a ſound, &amp; ſolide rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which in rigour of Diuinity may ſubſiſt of a poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conceipt, which may be rayſed of ſmall ground, or fancy, as all men know. And the ground of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, is, not becauſe the milk of the Virgin is more pure and precious then Chriſts bloud, but becauſe the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of approaching vnto it, may ſeeme to carry a ſhew of pride and preſumption. For a man to run to Chriſts bloud which was ſhed to cleanſe ſinners, is a token that he doth acknowledge himſelfe a ſinner, and a needy ſupplyant: but to approach the Virgins breaſts, which were not filled with milke, but only to nurſe the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, and comfort the ſpecially deuoted to Chriſts bleſſed childhood, might ſeeme to ſauour of pride and arrogancy. This may be declared by an example. Which is of more worth, a thouſand pounds out of the Kings Exchequer, or an ordinary diſh of meate ſet on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Kings refection? Doubtleſſe, the thouſand
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2519:25"/>pounds: yet is it a greater honour to ſit at table with the King, and eate with him in the ſame diſh, then to haue a thouſand pounds out of the Exchequer; and many that dare aske the ſecond, will not preſume of the firſt. The like is in this poeticall imagination. Chriſts bloud is more precious then his mothers milke, yet in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to ſit, as it were, at the ſame table with Chriſt, and to be fed with the ſame Virginall milke, miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly prepared for him, doth carry a greater ſhew of honour, then to be bathed in his bloud, and waſhed with his woundes, which ſinners are admitted vnto. And this is a ſufficient ground to build a pious poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conceipt, not vnbeſeeming a Chriſtian Poet, as any man of vnderſtanding will graunt; &amp; admyre the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelours madneſſe, who ſpendeth many leaues in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt Ieſuits, for this only reſpect, calling them, <hi>a generation of Vipers, bred of an old and ſinfull world, who as they haue Chriſt moſt in their mouth, ſo they haue him leſſe in their hart;</hi> and, <hi>that they haue herin more diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the bloud of Chriſt, then euer it was by any Sect, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion whatſoeuer, Turke or Heretike, Iew or Atheiſt, Diuell or Man, ſince the world began.</hi> Thus he declaymeth againſt Ieſuits, who do daily conuert vnto the deſire to be ſaued by Chriſts bloud, many of all the ſects by him named beſides Diuells, whome they leaue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with <hi>Luther</hi> and his learned Schollers. But theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues (as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of the like) are by ſo much the more ſottiſh, by how much they are more earneſt, and proue, that one only point Ieſuits muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily belieue of their long Ghoſpell, penned by <hi>M. Craſhaw,</hi> to wit, that the wryter therof, when he wrote it, was not well in his wits.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Which doth further appeare, in that he doth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2519:25"/>obiect in his fury, euen the elegancies of the Latyn la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which he doth not well vnderſtand, as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be condemned in Parliament. For example, the Ieſuite in this Poeme ſaith to Chriſt:<note place="margin">Ergo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptore monſtrate iure vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari; Nobilior reliquis ſi tibi ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis ineſt.</note>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Miniſter will needes accuſe the Ieſuits of doubting whether Chriſts bloud be more noble then any other, becauſe the Ieſuite maketh an <hi>(if)</hi> thereof which implyeth doubt. But would it pleaſe you to ſend your preacher to ſome Grammer ſchoole of Ieſuits, he ſhould be taught that <hi>(ſi, if)</hi> is not euer a doubting particle but ſometymes moſt aſſeueratiue, ſpecially in obſecrations, in which that particle vſed of ſomething which is certayne, doth with great force affirme, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſpeach more elegant, and the obſecration more earneſt. To giue him an example out of a poet, <hi>Dido</hi> doth thus beſeech <hi>Aeneas,</hi>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2519:26"/>rode on, ſpecially hearing the Prophet cry before him, <hi>I am become like a iument, or Aſſe before thee:</hi> and being no wiſer in the ſight of God, how dare he thus babble, if not rather bray in the eares of men that can vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſolemne foolery, to make it a ſinne for a man, to thinke, and ſay in the ſight of God, that he is more precious, and deare vnto him then any clout, euen the beſt that euer was: which though this ridiculous Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſay, that he doth prize aboue gold, and therefore much more then Ieſuits ſoules:<note place="margin">

            <p n="38">38. And if you examine the other part of his cauil at the Ieſuit, for enuying the clouts that were wet with that milke and bloud, you will find he doth ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelft to be a braying creature indeed, not onely in the ſight of God, but euen in the iudgment of euery reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Ieſuite meane the materiall, and reall bloud and milke, that were in the bodyes of Chriſt and his Mother, then is he more then mad to enuy the clouts, for they did touch them, and he cannot.</hi> Thus he. And is not this a fit diſcourſe (thinke you) to diſcouer a mad man? What if he cannot touch thoſe ſacred bodyes, that Virginall milke, and precious bloud? May he not therfore without madneſſe, wiſh that he had byn in the time when he might haue touched the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, enuying the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of the clouts, that were ſo happy, &amp; more happy in this reſpect, then he now can be?

But the Poets complaint is not in this reſpect, but hath an higher &amp; ſweeter conceipt, grieuing that he is not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2519:27"/>ſo happy in his kind, as thoſe cloutes were in theirs. They were corporally wet, and moyſtened with the bloud and milke of the Sonne and Mother, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour and felicity ſuch creatures could haue, wheras his ſoule, his vnderſtanding, his meditations, as he complayneth are not wet with a freſh and liuely remembrance of that milke, &amp; bloud, nor his thoughts &amp; affections drowned in theſe two mayne ſeas of ioves, nor he abſorpt by contemplation of thoſe two ſweet myſteryes, from the loue, and care of all other inferiour thinges. This is the complaint, which whether it be pious or no, let any man iudg, and of the vanity of ſuch cauills.</p>
            <p n="39">39. But it is worth the noting, that though your Bachelours drift was to beat in the morter of malice, with the peſtell of his piſtilent wit, euery flower of this flagrant poeme, to get out venemous iuice of ſome blaſphemy; yet hath he omitted ſome, at which he might haue cauilled with far more ſhew of reaſon: for example, at this verſe:
<q>
                  <l>Parce Deus, magno ſi te clamore fatigem.</l>
                  <l>Pardon me Lord, if thee my cryes doe tyre.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where he might haue obiected pride vnto the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, as to one thinking himſelf ſuch a ſtout prayer, as he can euen tyre God; and blaſphemy in teaching that God may be tyred: and hence haue deduced the Popiſh practiſe of praying vnto Saynts, which they doe (ſo might he cauill) to giue ſome reſpite vnto God that he may breath. Alſo when he ſaith:

            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:2519:27"/>Seeing no creature can bluſh which is not endued with reaſon. By this Ieſuits doctrine he might inferre, in his faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the launce was a reaſonable creature, man, or woman, rather a woman, becauſe the latyn is the feminine gender, perchance mother to the famous Knight Syr <hi>Launcelot Du-lake;</hi> but doubtles a Saynt, ſeeing ſhe was waſhed with Chriſts bloud, the vertue whereof made her bluſh for her ſinnes. Theſe dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (as I am content to refer to the Readers iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are no more iniurious againſt truth, and haue more wit and ſhew of reaſon in them, then the cloutes of the cauills, wherewith your Bachelour botcheth vp his Ghoſpell. And yet ſhould any man obiect theſe things in good earneſt, as things of moment and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that mans wits might be thought more wodden then the very wood of the launce, howſoeuer his malice may be more ſharp then the point: to which point of malice the Miniſters may ſeeme arriued, who are more ſharp ſet, and beare a greater tooth againſt Catholick deuotion and piety, then Atheiſme, and prophaneſſe; as your Bachelour did openly profeſſe, and they all ſhew it in workes. For ſo many wanton and laſciuious verſes come dayly forth, and ſuch workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are harboured euen in Preachers boſomes and breaſts: but this pious poeme full of ſo many ſweet, and deuout conceipts both towards Chriſt and his Mother, which malice only can miſconſter, and draw to blaſphemous ſenſes, you ſee, how theſe birds (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) of the light, cry, and cackle, and keepe a ſtirr at it, as if it were an owle, among whom your Preacher is leader.

               <p>The ſecond title is, <hi>Generalis Dei Vicarius in terris,</hi> Gods generall Vicar on earth: which name he will haue include the number of the beaſt, and to be the marke of Antichriſt, wherein he doth offer more wrong to Kinges, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes then vnto the Pope. For the Pope is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſtiled by vs, <hi>Gods Vicar,</hi> but, <hi>Chriſts Vicar,</hi> as all know: neither can the Miniſter find this title of Gods Generall Vicar giuen the Pope by any Catholicke: neither can it be an Antichriſtian title, which doth ſound of ſubiection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, which Antichriſt ſhall refuſe, extolling himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all that is called God.

                  <p n="10">10.

 not with diuine worſhip, but with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour honour, as repreſenting Gods perſon, as his ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and certaine Gods vpon earth.

 doctrine. Secondly he ſaith, that <hi>we hould the Pope to be aboue a Councell, aboue Scripture it ſelfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue Kings, and the reaſon is, becauſe he is God,</hi> which are vaſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. That the Pope is aboue a Councell, ſome Catholikes deny: that he is aboue holy Scripture we all deteſt, teaching that he is bound to belieue the doctrine, and to obey the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts therof. And though he be aboue Kings, as ſpirituall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction exceedeth temporall, yet the reaſon therof which we aſſigne, is not becauſe the Pope is God, &amp; God the King of Kings, which the Bachelour bringeth as ours, but becauſe the ſoule exceedeth the body, heauen ſurpaſſeth earth, and therfore the Paſtour of the ſoule, and the director vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is a more high, and excellent office, then that of earthly, and temporall power: ſo that in this his ſaying there is not one true word. And no leſſe falſe, and impudent is the next, that we hold <hi>that the Pope should take appeales from all the world, weare a triple crowne, be carryed on mens shoulders, giue his foot to be kiſſed, diſpoſe of Kings, and Kingdomes at his pleaſure: becauſe he that is God, may doe more then all theſe.</hi> For the Pope as all know that haue ſeen <hi>Rome,</hi> vſeth to go on foot, or in Litter, or in Coach, neyther doth he giue his foot to be kiſſed, though ſomtimes he permit the ſame to them that deſire to offer that ſigne of reuerence vnto Chriſt, whoſe Vicar he is; neyther doth he challenge the authority of taking appeales, in worldly and temporall affayres, but in Eccleſiaſticall only, much leſſe from all the world, wherof a great part is not Chriſtian; leaſt of all do Catholikes teach, that he can diſpoſe of Kings and Kingdomes at his pleaſure. But that which ſurpaſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure the bounds of modeſty, and truth, is that we deriue theſe doctrines from the Popes Godhead: what truth, modeſty, or ſhame can be in this fellow, that vſeth ſuch <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant lying, and rayling?</hi> What diſcretion of the Engliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to make him the patterne of their modeſt Preachers?

Thirdly it is falſe, and notoriouſly falſe, that the ſaid ſtory is there deliuered dogmatically, that is, as a matter of faith, there being no word out of which he may gather it; for though that booke was ſeene, and allowed to be printed by a Cardinall at the appoyntment of the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> yet it is ridiculous thence to inferr, that all matters contayned in a booke ſet out by authority, are pointes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, as any man of iudgment doth know, and the Bachelour doth affirme, that our learnedeſt authors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hold this ſtory to be a fable, as you ſhall heare.

The ſecond falſhood which he inferreth from the intruded title of Pope, is, that <hi>Gregory</hi> did the ſayd miracle as Pope, deliuering <hi>Traian</hi> out of hell, by his papall prerogatiue &amp; power, contrary to the authors of that ſtory who affirme that he did it by his prayers and by his teares, <hi>Bonus Gregorius oratione ſua infidelem Caeſarem eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit ad altiorem gradum.</hi> Holy <hi>Gregory</hi> (ſaith the booke he citeth) by his prayers lifted vp <hi>Traian</hi> to a higher degree.</p>

 that the Pope (in this re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect becauſe the miracle was done by a Pope) doth defend this booke of <hi>S.

Not with it ſelfe, for if by wicked, and damned, he vnderſtand wicked men that yet liue in this world, how can they be ſayd to be damned? If thoſe that are dead, and damned to hell, what need was there to ioyn wicked with damned, as though there were ſome damned that were not wicked? It agreeth not with the text, for if by the wicked he meane ſuch as yet ſuruiue in the world, it is falſe, that Chriſts charity neuer prayed for them, who on the Croſſe prayed for his Crucifyers. If he meane the wicked that are ſentenced to eternall fire, how can they be tearmed the world, that are in hell and out of the world? Finally this expoſition makes not for his purpoſe, for if by damned he vnderſtand thoſe that are irreuocably iudged to hell, the Pope neuer prayed for ſuch, ſeeing <hi>Traian,</hi> whoſe fable is the cauſe of this ſtorme, was not condemned, but his ſentence ſuſpended vpon the foreſight of <hi>S.

The only proofe he ſtandeth vpon, is the ſaying of an <hi>Italian</hi> Fryer, by name <hi>Bernardinus de Buſto,</hi> who liued 120. yeares agoe, as eloquent (he ſaith) in his tyme, as euer was <hi>Panigarola</hi> in theſe later.<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>66.</hi> both in the margent &amp; text.</note>
 And one ſentence tending to the former blaſphemy found in him onely, he doth make <hi>the generally receaued doctrine of Popery, by the law</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>of Acceſſaries, becauſe the booke was dedicated vnto Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſixt,</hi> and ſo this doctrine of the Fryer allowed as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Catholike Diuinity by him.

For firſt though the booke were dedicated to the Pope, yet doth it not follow, that the Pope did euer peruſe the ſame, or any part therof, eyther before, or after the printing. How many books come forth, which the Patrons to whome they are dedicated, did neuer read, or know of, before they appeared with their names? How could this Pope be acceſſarie to the doctrine of the booke, which he neuer read, as it is very probable he did not, being full of other buſineſſe, and this booke of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardinus</hi> very long?

 or two wayes to declare the manner of worſhiping the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Chriſt, or Croſſes, which yet, as you ſhall ſee, come in effect to be both one.

For this manner is, that by the <hi>image remembring Chriſt,</hi> we worſhip and honour him, directing vnto him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence which is due, ſhewing outward ſignes thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his image, as kneeling vnto, kiſſing, and imbracing the ſame, referring thoſe acts (as the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> teacheth<note n="*" place="margin">Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio impertien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, non quòd cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur ineſſe ipſis aliqua di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitas, vel virtus propter quam ſint colendaes ſed quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am honos qui ipſis exhibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad Prototypa quae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 25. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. de ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</hi>

) to teſtify the inward reſpect, and affection we beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Sauiour, reſembled by his image; by which ſignes of diuine worſhip, though not directed to the Image of Chriſt, yet done before it, doth redound ſome kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto the very image, theſe ſignes ſhewing the dignity thereof, the greateſt an image, as image, can haue, to wit, to repreſent him whom we worſhip with diuine worſhip, whom, did not that image reſemble, we would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before it. This manner of honouring Images, not by honouring them directly in themſelues, but another, in, or before them, both with one and the ſame act, may be declared by a contrary example of the prophaning, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonouring of Churches by the ſacrilegious murther of a Prieſt, or ſacred perſon in them. For that ſacriledge, though not done directly vpon the Church, which is not killed, nor the murtherer ſo ſottiſh as to intend the killing therof; yet by doing the murther in the Church, or neere the Church, the ſame Church is truly prophaned by that very murther, wherewith the Church is not hurt. And as it were
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2519:100"/>folly to infer, the Church is prophaned by the ſame act a man is killed, which is murther, therefore the Church is murthered, or that act is a murther of the Church: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is groſſe ignorance to argue, that we giue diuine worſhip to Chriſts Image, becauſe the ſame is honoured togeather with Chriſt, by one, and the ſame act, which act is diuine worſhip of the one, but not of the other. By this you may perceyue that there is ſmall difference if any (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> noteth)<note n="(o)" place="margin">lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Imag. c. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note>
 betwixt theſe two manners of declaring the adoration of Images, for both agree that the reſpect, and honour due, and giuen to the Images of Chriſt by themſelues, is infinitely inferiour vnto diuine, and ſuch as doth not reach to the honour due vnto the meaneſt Saynt: but is anſwerable only to the dignity of a ſigne, or figure to put vs in mind of him, whom we worſhip as God; and in this all Catholikes agree againſt the ſlaunders of the Bachelour, and his Mates. The ſeeming difference is in the manner, how this inferiour reſpect and honour comes to Chriſts Image, whether by a proper and ſpeciall act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence giuen vnto it, which is a more perfect manner of honouring a thing, or by worſhipping Chriſt before the ſame, many tymes without ſo much as thinking of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which is indeed moſt perfectly to adore the Image of Chriſt, as an Image, whoſe office is, not to ſtand for it ſelfe, but for another, and to make vs only thinke of, &amp; loue, and reuerence him, whom it doth repreſent, forgetting all other things: as when we caſt an account, we only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the number of 20. 50. or 100. for which the counter ſtandeth, not regarding the ſame in it ſelfe, whether it be braſſe, or ſiluer, black or yellow, great or little.

Secondly theſe other wordes of <hi>Valentia, Imagines venerandae ſunt non per ſe quatenus tali materia continentur, ſed per aliud, ſcilicet ratione prototypi,</hi> he doth imperfectly tranſlate: Images are to be worſhiped not for themſelues, nor for the matter nor formes ſake, but for his ſake they reſemble. Which tranſlation though <hi>Valentia</hi> had ſaid no more, doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemne the Bachelour of ſlaunderous accuſing vs to teach that Images are to be worſhiped as God, ſeeing God muſt be worſhiped for himſelf, and for his owne dignity &amp; Maieſty, not for anothers ſake only whom he reſembleth, as Images are. Nay to worſhip God in that ſort were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to blaſpheme, then worſhip him: for did we honour

But indeed <hi>Valentia</hi> ſaith yet more in Latin, which the Bachelour would not let him vtter in Engliſh, for he ſaith, that Images are not to be worſhipped <hi>per ſe, ſed per aliud,</hi> not by themſelues, but by another, that is, they are not only to be honoured for his ſake only whom they repreſent, and not their owne, but alſo not to be worſhipped in themſelues,<note place="margin">Saintes are honou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, yet for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers ſake Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their own ſake, nor by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without Chriſt.</note>

19. Now in the body of the article, <hi>S. Thomas</hi> is ſo far from teaching to pray, &amp; giue diuine worſhip to the Croſſe, by it ſelfe, and not to Chriſt, that he teacheth the contrary expreſly, for thus he doth diſcourſe. <hi>To the Croſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by it ſelfe no worship at all</hi> (eyther diuine, or not diuine) <hi>is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, becauſe reuerence, and honour is due onely to a reaſonable creature: inſenſible things we muſt worship only as they concerne reaſonable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall natures, which they may doe two wayes, eyther becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, or becauſe they touch ſome perſon that is worthy of honour. In this ſort men worship both the Image, and garment of a King, becauſe the one doth repreſent, the other touch his ſacred perſon, both which thinges they worship by the ſame worship they worship the King,</hi> that is, not giuing or directing acts of worſhip to his Image or garment a part by themſelues, but giuing Royall honour vnto the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2519:105"/>in the one, and cloathed in the the other: ſo that by kiſſing the Kings robes, we doe teſtify the duty we owe, not to the garment, but to the King. In this manner <hi>S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> teacheth, that we ought to worſhip the Croſſe of Chriſt, which is both his Image, repreſenting the forme and figure of his crucified body, as alſo a Relique that touched his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred fleſh, grayned with his precious bloud, not directing diuine worſhip to the Croſſe, but in his Croſſe conceauing him as ſtretched vpon it, and as ſanctifying the ſame with the ſacred touch of his diuine perſon, in which we doe ſo liuely apprehend Chriſt, and behould him with the eyes of our mind, that (ſaith he) <hi>Crucem alloquimur quaſi ipſum Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixum;</hi> which words the Bachelour doth tranſlate: We ſpeake vnto the Croſſe, aſwell as vnto him that dyed on it; giuing the ſentence a blaſphemous ſenſe, contrary both to the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the words, and meaning of the Author, which indeed is that we ſpeake to the Croſſe, as if we ſpake to Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelfe; as in repreſentations, he that beareth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, the reſt <hi>alloquuntur eum quaſi Regem,</hi> ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, not aſwell as to a King, but in the ſame manner as they would ſpeake to that King he repreſents, were he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed preſent, whom they imagine preſent in him that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents his perſon, as Catholikes do, and all Chriſtians ought to doe when they ſee Chriſts Image, to looke on the Croſſe, not as it ſtandeth for it ſelfe, but for him that dyed on it, whome we imagine as preſent, and pray vnto him, as if we ſaw him before vs with our eyes, ſtretched in forme of a Croſſe. Which deuotion that holy Roman Matrone <hi>S. Paula</hi> did practiſe, and is in this reſpect highly commended by <hi>S. Hierome:</hi>

               <p n="23">23. VVherefore not to trouble thee longer (gentle Reader) I will conclude this diſcourſe about Images, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue beene the longer to make the Bachelours ſlaunders apparent to the iudgment of all reaſonable men that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe matters, and to ſhew their ſhamefull lying about Idolatry, moſt frequent with their moſt ignorant Preachers. And to a Iury of learned or intelligent men, that will ſpeake as they thinke, of what Religion ſoeuer, I am content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this whole cauſe for them to iudge, whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Procter hath performed his promiſe; or whether fayling therein, he be not bound to recant publickly with ſhame at the Croſſe. His promiſe (if you remember) was, to proue three things <hi>apparently to the iudgment of euery reaſonable man.</hi> Firſt to bring the greateſt number of our later writers that giue diuine worſhip to Chriſts Image; in performance whereof he hath brought only the teſtimonyes of three or foure at the moſt.<note place="margin">M. Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued what he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke.</note>
 Now, are our late writers not aboue the number of ſeauen, that foure are the greateſt number of them apparently in the iudgment of euery reaſonable man? What Chymera's will he dreame of being drunke, that can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſuch fables being ſober? The ſecond part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was to bring our beſt approued Authors for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine; which promiſe if he were ſober when he made it, doubtleſſe he forgot to be ſober when he came to performe it. For he bringeth only <hi>Valentia, Gretzerus, Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fijs,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtomus à Viſitatione,</hi> who are I confeſſe learned Authours; but whether they are our beſt I much doubt. Many will prefer <hi>Bellarmine, Suares,</hi> and <hi>Saunders</hi> before them; and ſure I am, they are not the beſt apparently in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery reaſonable man. But the third part of his promiſe to proue that theſe authors giue diuine worſhip to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2519:107"/>Chriſts Image apparently in the iudgment of euery reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, is much more exorbitant, &amp; void eyther of truth, or ſobernes; ſeeing in their ſentences they vſe many tearmes, as <hi>per ſe,</hi> and <hi>per aliud, abſolutè</hi> and <hi>relatiuè, imago vt imago, &amp; vt resquaedam,</hi> and the like, as you haue heard, which it is as cleere as noone-day, are not vnderſtood of euery reaſonable man. Nay <hi>M. Crashaw</hi> doth not vnderſtand them himſelf, as hath bene cleerly ſhewed, whom yet in this reſpect we will not number among brute creatures.</p>
               <p n="24">24. VVhere I will not omit to remoue a doubt which I find a ſtumbling block to ſome Proteſtants of no meane vnderſtanding, to wit,<note place="margin">A difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts againſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note>
 that theſe diſtinctions wherwith we declare the worſhip of Images, are obſcure, which vulgar people vnderſtand not, and that conſequently they cannot tell how they may ſafely worſhip Images, without danger of falſe worſhip. To which I anſwere, that many tymes the actions that in practiſe are moſt eaſy &amp; facile, their natures are moſt obſcure, and hard to be ſpeculatiuely declared, and made known vnto vulgar people, who know how to doe them, though not how to declare them. What more eaſy for a man then to mooue, or walke,<note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>
 and yet to declare the nature of that action the Philoſophers are forced to vſe the diſtinctions of <hi>intrinſecè vel extrinſecè, per vltimum non eſſe, vel primum eſſe,</hi> and the like, which can neuer be beaten into the heades of common people, whoſe feete are no leſſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance more nimble, and skilfull to moue then are the Philoſophers, whoſe head is full of theſe quirkes. The ſame doth happen in the worſhipping of Images, then which no religious action is more eaſy to practice piouſly, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out errour, nature it ſelfe teaching vs to honour and loue the Images of them that are deare vnto vs, which euen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and women by inſtinct of nature doe practiſe, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that therein they ſhew their loue to their friends, though they know not the meanes which Deuines, and Philoſophers vſe to declare the matter. And as comom people who know no more of mouing, then that it is to ſet one foote before another, walke as faſt, and with as litle danger of falling as the greateſt ſcholler that can with his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2519:108"/>ſubtile wit anatomize that action: ſo likewiſe ignorant men or wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that know no more of worſhipping Images, then that they muſt remember Chriſt when they ſee them, and kneele vnto him before them, kiſſing, and imbracing them, to ſignify how dearly they doe loue him, whome thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble: ſuch men &amp; women, I ſay, may worſhip an Image of Chriſt, as deuoutly, as ſecurely, and with as little danger or falſe worſhip, as the moſt learned Deuine, that can lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly explicate the manner, how by the Image diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is conueyed vnto Chriſt, &amp; how by honouring Chriſt in his Image, honour is deriued vnto the Image, by one, and the ſelfe ſame act, which is diuine honour to Chriſt, but not of the Image, worſhipping the ſame, not abſolutely, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiuely, not by it ſelfe, but by another. For this honouring of him, whome we loue in his Image, kiſſing &amp; imbracing the ſame, is an action as naturall to a man, and with as great facility done, as walking, or any other. Faith doth teach that Chriſt is God, and to be honoured with diuine worſhip, &amp; the ſpirit of God moueth our hart to loue him, as ſo great a Lord, and louer doth deſerue; which faith and loue ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is as facile and naturall in men, to kiſſe and imbrace Chriſts Image, to ſhew the honour, &amp; loue they beare him, as is for any other man or woman, to doe the ſame towards the image of one whome they affect; which is ſo ingraffed in their nature, that none that are come to the vſe of reaſon are ſo rude, and groſſe, but can vſe the ſame without further teaching.</p>

 to wit, by a Biſhop, &amp; lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger prayers made at the bleſſing of the one, then in the baptiſme of the other.

But the Bells bleſſing hath vertue from the authority of the Church, and the efficacy of her prayers, and therfore this bleſſing is of more vertue, when both the Miniſter therof is of greater power, and the prayers vſed therat more deuout, &amp; pleaſing vnto God, ſo that the greater ſolemnity in this bleſſing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that of baptiſme, doth rather proue againſt our Bachlour then for him, that one is a Sacrament and not the other.

; and that therfore <hi>S.

For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth, that the vow of continency is broken eyther by fornication, or by marriage, but in different ſort. After for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſuch as haue vowed and broken their vow, may repent, and keep their vow of chaſtity the remnant of their life, which after marriage they cannot. For though they repent of the breach of their vow, yet being marryed, they cannot lead a ſingle life, hauing giuen away the power of their body by that contract, in which reſpect to marry, is more againſt their promiſe of fidelity, though abſolutely the other be the greater ſinne. Which may be ſhewed by the example of a woman, that hauing betroathed herſelf to one, marryeth another, abſolutely ſpeaking, ſhe ſinneth leſſe by this marrying then by committing fornication; yet if we regard her promiſe, ſhe breakes that more by marrying,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2519:142"/>which makes her vnable to keep her promiſe, though ſhe would: to which fornication doth not altogeather vnable her.

Wherefore this wound being made only vpon the bare word of ſo graue a witnes, we muſt leaue it as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, not being in our power to ſtay his tongue from wounding the ſoules, and conſciences of credulous people, that will belieue all <hi>he dare ſay,</hi> without any proofe, on whom he loadeth many damnable woundes that muſt needes cauſe in them (if they be not healed) eternall death.</p>

 &amp; other Hereticks did in former tymes. Concerning which we will briefly conſider two things. Firſt the quality of the witneſſes which he bringeth, and how they make againſt him. Secondly the accuſation it ſelfe, how vaine, &amp; emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of no ſubſtance it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To begin with the witneſſes that complaine of the lewd life of ſome Catholiks, I demaund of <hi>M. Crashaw,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Proteſtants or Catholikes themſelues? not Proteſtants, for then he ſhould produce, contrary to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, his owne men againſt vs. They were Catholikes then, as he doth confeſſe. Then I demaund againe, whether they had conſcience or no? if they were without conſcience, then doth he produce faithleſſe witneſſes, ready to ſpeake vntruth without any ſcruple; wherfore the Bachelour doth grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo that theſe Catholikes, or Papiſts (as is his phraſe) had conſcience, and <hi>out of remorſe of conſcience, and feare of God, did confeſſe freely, and deplore bitterly the miſery that the ſinfulnes of the Romish Church would bring vpon the world.</hi> Thirdly I demaund, where they came to that conſcience, or feare of God? By the preaching of what Miniſtery? By the Sacraments of what Church? By the doctrine of what faith? Doubtleſſe of the Roman faith, Miniſtry, and Church, wherin they both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and dyed obedient children. This being certaine, let <hi>M. Crashaw</hi> call to mind what he teacheth againſt the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, <hi>that a good conſcience cannot be ſeuered from effectuall calling. And how can that be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but a true Church, wherin men are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily begotten to God? How can that be but an holy, and lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry that brings men to ſaluation?</hi>

 Thus he. Now let <hi>M. Crashaw</hi> ſpeake whether it were not a good conſcience, the remorſe wherof moued theſe men to deteſt the ſinfulnes of many in the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church? Whether that was not true feare of God that did make them ſo bitterly deplore it? Then againe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe men came to conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce without effectuall calling, or were effectually called by the meanes of a falſe Church: or elſe the Roman is the true Church, deteſting bad life, whoſe doctrine breedeth in her louing children ſuch an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred therof. And theſe Saintes, and holy men, as they are
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2519:146"/>witneſſes againſt the bad life of Catholiks, which we much more then Proteſtants abhorre; ſo likewiſe their example of not forſaking the Church, notwithſtanding the knowne bad life of ſome, will be a teſtimony at the day of iudgment againſt the damnable pride of the Proteſtant reuolt, out of a pretended horrour againſt ſinne: wherin they are neyther like theſe holy men of our Church, nor the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Prophets, <hi>who</hi> (as <hi>S.

                  <hi>and the honour of his Apoſtolicall ſeat (which cannot erre nor doe amiſſe, as he like a foole confeſſed) ſorthwith order was taken that he should not trouble the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2519:147"/>world, nor diſgrace his place any longer, for he ſoone dyed.</hi> Where he would giue his Reader to vnderſtand, that the life of this Pope was by Catholicks abridged, becauſe he might ſeeme to affect the Proteſtant reformation. Now the praiſes the Bachelour layeth on this Pope, comming from ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary of Popes, no man may think other motiue did force him thereunto but truth, as indeed this Pope was both pious, wiſe, and learned, a Doctor, and Reader in <hi>Louayne,</hi> Maiſter afterward to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour of famous memory, and Gouernour of his Kingdomes in <hi>Spayne</hi> in his abſence, from whence he was called to the dignity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea.

                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:2519:147"/>4. This, and much more writeth this Pope. By which you may perceiue firſt what a lewd fellow, and naughty hart <hi>Luther</hi> was, vnto whom this Good man, and <hi>honeſt hart</hi> was as oppoſite as heauen vnto earth, Chriſt vnto <hi>Belial,</hi> God vnto the Diuell. Secondly how falſely this Bachelour did auouch, that this Pop forgot himſelfe, and the honour of his Sea, which cannot erre, nor doe amiſſe as he like a foole confeſſed, where, beſides the ſcurrility of his ſpeach, laying that title on ſo learned, and worthy a Prelate, which vnder payne of hell fire may not be giuen to the meaneſt Chriſtian: Beſides this ſcoffe, I ſay, marke the fate (ſhall I ſay) or folly of this fellow whoſe luck is ſuch, that when he would ſeeme wiſe, and cenſure others as fooles, he ſtill playeth the foole notoriouſly himſelf, as now in ſaying that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> did <hi>diſgrace his Sea by confeſſing like a foole, that the ſame could not erre, nor doe amiſſe.</hi> For is it a diſgrace to a Biſhop, or to his Chayre, that he cannot erre, nor doe amiſſe? How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did the Pope diſgrace his Chayre, or play the foole in confeſſing that his Chayre could not erre. But to leaue the Bachelours folly, who by great chance ſtumbled on a truth againſt his will, let vs take his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was to tell a lye, to wit, that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> did confeſſe his Sea could erre, which other Popes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks deny; which to be falſe is made cleare by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words of the Pope, in which he doth conſtantly mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the dignity of his Sea againſt <hi>Luther</hi> as you haue heard.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And ſuppoſe he had graunted, that ſome Popes his Predeceſſors in that Sea had abuſed their authority, had not liued ſo well as that great dignity did require, had erred in matters of fact, though in the very truth this Pope doth not ſay ſo much, but only that ſome abuſes were in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are, and euer will be more or leſſe in all Courts in the world, which he made promiſe to doe his beſt to reforme: yet had the Pope graunted that ſome of his predeceſſors had done amiſſe, did he therefore forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the dignity of his Sea? What Catholicke doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this dignity to the Roman Sea, that the Biſhop thereof may not lead a bad life, and in his deeds ſwarue
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2519:148"/>from his doctrine? Nay contrarywiſe we challenge this to be the dignity of his Sea, and chayre, that though the Biſhop thereof be wicked, and of ill life (as he may be) yet he can neuer teach nor define any falſe doctrine, which is the priuiledge of the true Church, &amp; the Paſtour therof, as <hi>S.</hi>

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> taught long agoe.

For the thinges they ſpeake are not their owne, but of God, who in the Chayre of vnity hath placed the doctrine of verity. Thus <hi>S.

, <hi>perchance we should not
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:2519:148"/>preuaile much againſt it by our doctrine of faith.</hi> And more clearly in the ſame place. <hi>If Popery had the ſame ſanctity, and auſterity of life, which it had in the tyme of the Fathers, Hierome, Ambroſe, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, and others, what should we be able now to do againſt it?</hi> Thus <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Where you ſee he doth both confeſſe that the ancient Fathers moſt famous for ſanctity were Papiſts, the Church in their dayes Popiſh, and that had he preached his Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in their dayes, or they liued when he began to preach, their ſanctity would haue deteſted the ſame, their learning haue cruſht the brat of liberty in the cradle. Let the Reader iudge what a Ghoſpell that is, which antiquity would haue reſiſted, ſanctity deteſted, the Church of God in her beſt tymes, not ſo much as haue heard of; which finally could neuer haue preuayled, but in this laſt age, when diſſolution and loue of liberty hath preuayled againſt the ancient diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and ſanctity of the Church, ſo that by this rayling they defile their owne neſt, they ſhake the ground of their Ghoſpell, ſtyr that ſtinking puddle, out of which their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours did iſſue, and ſhew themſelues vnthankefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Parent, and Mother, which is the rotten, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt life of many Catholikes.</p>

. Is not the Diuell, thinke you, a fit iudge to take vp the

And though the Diuell ſhould ſay it againe, &amp; againe, that their Church is healed, ſhould we therfore belieue it? No truly; that were as great madnes, as was <hi>Luther</hi> to belieue vpon the Diuels wordes, and arguments the Catholike Church was wounded.</p>

 he will (he ſaith) <hi>become one of them,</hi> which perchance he ſpake from his hart, who may be one of them already, though his body be Proteſtant. The foure queſtions are: <hi>VVherin the Church of England is deadly wounded? In what Church were they, the Browniſts healed?</hi>
